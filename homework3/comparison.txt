Docker is a containers with a complete filsystem that contains everything needed to run. Therefore, a program can be run regardless of the OS or environment that it is being executed. Singularity is a container as well, but instead of needing to install all the needed library and have a separate filesystem, it interacts with the host system directly, thus at a native speed. It is usually used for High-performance computing and much easier to move it around. When the focus is on the development, Docker is preferred, while moving the application from one environment to another, Singularity is preferred.
